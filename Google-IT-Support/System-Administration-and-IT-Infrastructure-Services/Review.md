## System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services

### Week 1

IT infrastructure : encompasses the software, hardware, network, an services required for an organization to operate in an enterprise IT environment

System Administration : sysadmin is responsible for their company's I.T. 

Cloud computing : The concept that user can access user's data, use applications, store files from anywhere in the world as long as user has an internet connection

System Administration Task 
1. Decide what computer policies to user
2. Manage users and hardware
3. Responsible for user machine (i.e. printer)
4. Routine Maintenance 

	Hardware lifecycle
    1. Procurement
    2. Deployment
    3. Maintenance
    4. Retirement

### Week 2

Types of IT Infrastructure Services
- Physical
- Software
- Network
- Directory

> 
1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
IaaS provider give user pre-configured virtual machines that user can user just as if user had a physical server
2. NaaS (Network as a Service)
NaaS allows companies to offshore their networking services so that they don't have to deal with the expensive networking hardware
3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
4. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Physical Infrastructure Systems
- Server Operating Systems : Regular operatinng systems that are optimized for server functionality
- Virtualization 
	- Dedicated Hardware : Better performance, 
    - Virtualized Instance : Most cost-effective, easier maintenance, reduces points of failure

Network Services
- File Transfer Protocol `FTP` -  legacy way to transfer files from one computer to another over the Internet; not secure due to no data encryption
	- Secured File Transfer Protocol `SFTP` - secured version of file transfer (SSH encryprion + Authentication)
	- Trivial File Transfer Protocol `TFTP` - 
- Network Time Protocol `NTP` - allow machines to synchronize their clocks (Ubuntu installations include a daemon that runs on the machine and is in charge of synchronizing the clock using NTP)
	- i.e. NTP daemon running status check in Linux `service NTP status`
